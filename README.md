# Opinion-mining-from-reviews

Academic project, written for course "Natural Language Processing".  

This was a Kaggle-like competition between students. We were given a test data-set of annotated product reviews. Each review mentioned some feature of a product: price, quality, etc.   
The goal was to produce a solution, which automatically annotate previously unknown reviews (multiclass classification).   

-Implemented parser from given json format  
-Designed a solution with use of NLTK and scikit-learn
